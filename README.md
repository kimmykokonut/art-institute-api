## Description
### This is a pair project I worked on at Epicodus Bootcamp to practice using API calling skills.  This app uses two separate APIs to build a websit where you can search for a painting by keyword name and receive the title, artist, an image of the painting, a description of the painting and if the painting is currently on display at the Art Institute.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

1. Navigate to my github repository for this project (https://github.com/kimmykokonut/art-institute-api)
2. Click the 'Fork' button and you will be taken to a new page where you can give your repository a new name and description. Choose "create fork".
3. Click the 'code' button and copy the url for HTTPS.
4. On your local computer, create a working directory for my files and name appropriately.
5. On your terminal, type $ git clone 'url' (using the url from step 3.)
6. On your terminal, type $ code . to open in VS Code. If you do not have VS Code Editor, you may download here: https://code.visualstudio.com/
7. Once in VS Code, open the terminal there and type $ npm install (to install the packages and dependencies).
8. Update the files to your liking.  
9. You do not need an API key for Chicago's Art Institute
10. To see it rendered in a browser you can start a development server by typing $ npm run start in the VS Code terminal and it should open a browser window located at localhost.8080
